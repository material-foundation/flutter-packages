# adaptive_navigation

[![pub package](https://img.shields.io/pub/v/adaptive_navigation.svg)](https://pub.dev/packages/adaptive_navigation)

A package that contains a component for adaptive switching between `BottomNavigationBar`, `NavigationRail`, and `Drawer`.

[Demo](https://adaptive-navigation.web.app/#/)

> **Note**
> This is an opinionated implementation of adaptive navigation in Material. While there are some
basic options for switching the adaptive behavior, it is not meant to support advanced or custom
configurations. For example, if you need an extended Navigation Rail or a Drawer with custom
actions, this package should not be used. It can still, however, be used a reference for breakpoint
logic and navigation destination mapping.
